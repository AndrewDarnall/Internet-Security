The demo implementation consists in a vulnerable web app that shows how a regular blind sql
injection works + the same program with the patch that prevents the attack.

Then there I will implement a web app that is vulnerable to a blind sql injection + the same web app
with the 'patch' that prevents that attack

It could be fruitful to include all types of sql injections attacks, show an example
of them + their prevention/patch

An important aspect of the project is the history of the attack, when it begain, who invented it
when has it been the most popular and what are the current statistics on this particular type
of attack

Do note that as of the moment I am writing this, code injections attacks are the most popular
types of attacks that there are (not specific to sql injections though)
