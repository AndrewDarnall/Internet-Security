# Internet-Security ~ Project Work

This repo is meant to document the project work of the Internet Security course of my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science

## Project Work

The goal of the project work is to study stored sql injections, with emphasis on the defensive (blue teaming) aspect of said vulnerability, which means studying the state of the art, the history of the vulnerability, the statistics on how many systems were and are currently vulnerable to this particular type of attack, how to prevent it and draw my conclusions in a formal report

I will also create a demo (an implementation) of the exploit, how it differs from a blind sql injection, what other types of sql injections exit, what types of tools can penetration testers use to exploit said vulnerability and show what can be done to prevent said vulnerability from being exploited.

This particular vulnerability falls under the umbrella of Web Vulnerabilities
